								<p>Tea is a common beverage made from steeping processed Camellia sinensis leaves with hot water. There are two main varieties of Camellia sinensis:

	The first variety is Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which produces teas that are bright and fresh to rich and malty in taste. This small-leaved plant is usually grown in mountainous regions with cool and misty climates, such as in China, Taiwan, and Japan.

	The second variety is the Camellia sinensis var. assamica, which produces teas that are mellow and grassy to brisk and malty in taste. This plant is large-leaved and usually grown in tropical areas such as India, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. 

	Meanwhile, there are six main types of teas: white, yellow, green, oolong, black, and puerh. Each tea type has its own unique processing methods and brewing times.

									<p>Tea is a drink that is produced from the combination of cured leaves of the Camellia Sinensis (tea) plant with hot water. Tea is the second most popular beverage in the world, after water. The Camellia Sinensis plant thrives growing in tropical and sub-tropical climates, hence its origins on the continents of Asia and Africa.

	The first recorded consumption in the history of tea was in China, as early as the 10th century BC. Soon, it spread to Korea and Japan. During the 16th century Portuguese exploration of the Far East, tea was traded with the West and as a result, the tea plant spread to the rest of the world. It has been said that Catherine of Braganza, the Portuguese queen consort to King Charles II, introduced the drinking of tea in the UK.It wasn't until the 19th century.

										<p>Tea is a name given to a lot of brews, but purists consider only green tea, black tea, white tea, oolong tea, and pu-erh tea the real thing. They are all derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, a shrub native to China and India, and contain unique antioxidants called flavonoids. The most potent of these, known as ECGC, may help against free radicals that can contribute to cancer, heart disease, and clogged arteries.

	All these teas also have caffeine and theanine, which affect the brain and seem to heighten mental alertness.

	The more processed the tea leaves, usually the less polyphenol content. Polyphenols include flavonoids. Oolong and black teas are oxidized or fermented, so they have lower concentrations of polyphenols than green tea; but their antioxidizing power is still high.
